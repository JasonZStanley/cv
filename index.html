						<h3>Professional</h3>
						<article>
							<p>I can manage and motivate small teams. I work well with others. As my job roles have evolved I have been required to learn new languages, frameworks and CMS's at short notice. I have always risen to the challenge, often reading documentation in my own time to ensure that I could cater to the changing needs of managers and clients quickly.</p>

							<p>At CMD I was a problem solver, frequently turning around projects which were behind schedule or not matching the brief. I leave a good impression with people I work with and am frequently praised for my hard work and attitude.</p>

						<h3>Personal</h3>

						<h3>Notes</h3>
						<article>
							<p>I have a stutter. It doesn't affect my day to day work and disappears as I get to know colleagues. I am good at what I do but this can sometimes be masked or fail to come across because my speech has taken a dip in a brief interview. Please be reassured that as I settle into a job or project my verbal communication greatly improves. Should you wish to interview me I would appreciate a bit of patience and perhaps an alternative method to communicate (Whiteboard, pen and paper etc). Often just having another option to communicate relieves stress and improves my fluency</p>
